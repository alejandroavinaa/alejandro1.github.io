        <p> Hello, my name is Alejandro. I have worked in the manufacturing field as a CNC programmer for five years
            after graduating with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. I enjoy working hands on, and my career path 
            has provided me work that allows for me to manufacture parts through CNC. 
            I am a hard-working and driven individual who is not afraid to face a challenge.

            I am taking this course because I wanted to learn a bit more about web deveolpment. I like the challenges 
            working on web deveolpment provides. I wish to learn how to use more tools to create better websites. I look
            forward to learning a lot in this course.
